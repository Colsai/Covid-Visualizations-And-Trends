# Covid Trends Mapping with NYT's Github and Visualizations

With Covid on everyone's mind, this dataset looks at the cases and death trends. 
- Visualizations of trends in cases/deaths
- Analysis on what 'wave' we are on
- Adding different metrics, such as daily changes, percent change, 7/14/42 SMA,
- I have also included a simple linear prediciton model that uses scikit learn (at present, it is very simple but gives some estimate of what deaths might do).

I have been slowly looking through
PBL (Project-based learning) where I do exploratory data analysis.
I am sourcing my data from NYT's github.
